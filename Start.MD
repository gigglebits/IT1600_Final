# Postbook Walk Though
### By Trevor Gentry

This walk though will take you through my mindset when approaching a puzzle such as the Postbook capture the flag challenge presented by Hacker101 and available at [Hacker101](ctf.hacker101.com). For the sake of organization and to provide benefit to people looking for help on a certain flag this won't be the exact order I would approach the flags going in blind, but will go in the flag order number. 

This tutorial is intended for people who have a decent handle on basic IT and security concepts such as:
- Basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Knowledge of brute force attacks.
- Basic understanding of web security.
